# 💯 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! 🚀  
Every day, I will be coding and committing at least one project, script, or notebook. The goal is to build consistency, grow my skills, and document my progress publicly.

## 🔥 Challenge Rules

- I will code for at least **1 hour every day** for the next **100 days**.
- I will post updates daily to this repository.
- I will work on a variety of projects — including data science, Python scripting, machine learning, and web automation.

## 📅 Progress

I will update this file periodically with summaries or milestone reflections.

| Day | Project | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1   | ARIMA Forecast | Built a time series forecasting model on Safaricom stock data using ARIMA. |

## 📌 Why?

I believe consistency is the key to mastering coding. This challenge will help me:

- Practice coding daily 🧠  
- Build a strong portfolio 📁  
- Stay accountable by sharing publicly 🔗
